# HourWindowWF
A watchface for the Pebble watches that shows an analog clock with only the present hour shown and a minute hand.

The original idea comes from [joeytitans](https://www.reddit.com/user/joeytitans) in Reddit where [he posted about the real wallclock](https://www.reddit.com/r/pebble/comments/350zoy/face_any_minimalist_faces_similar_to_this/) with this style.

As my first watchface, in order to get the configuration HTML page done, I got help and some code from the app [PebbleAuth](https://github.com/JumpMaster/PebbleAuth) by author [JumpMaster](https://github.com/JumpMaster).

I should also thank the authors of the code for[making bezier curves](https://github.com/pebble-hacks/gpath-bezier) extremely easy in Pebble, in this watchface it has been used in a tiny detail, but I'll use it in future ideas more widely!
