# HourWindowWF
A minimalistic watchface for the Pebble watches that shows an analog clock with only the present hour shown and a minute hand.

The original idea comes from [joeytitans](https://www.reddit.com/user/joeytitans) in Reddit where [he posted about the real wallclock](https://www.reddit.com/r/pebble/comments/350zoy/face_any_minimalist_faces_similar_to_this/) with this style.

As my first watchface, in order to get the configuration HTML page done, I got help and some code from the app [PebbleAuth](https://github.com/JumpMaster/PebbleAuth) by author [JumpMaster](https://github.com/JumpMaster).

I should also thank the authors of the code for[making bezier curves](https://github.com/pebble-hacks/gpath-bezier) extremely easy in Pebble, in this watchface it has been used in a tiny detail, but I'll use it in future ideas more widely!

Special thanks to Reddit users PiwwowPants and Limp1 that helped me test on real devices and sent pictures of it.
